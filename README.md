# Distroless Image in Docker
Distroless is a set of minimalist base images for containers, created by Google. Unlike traditional base images that include a full operating system, Distroless images aim to provide the bare essentials required to run an application.

## Key Features

1. **Minimalistic Design:**
   Distroless images are designed to be minimal and contain only the necessary components to run an application. This reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.

2. **No Package Manager:**
   Distroless images do not include package managers like APT or Yum. This eliminates the need for regular package updates and reduces the image size.

3. **Focused on Security:**
   By excluding unnecessary components and tools, Distroless images enhance the security posture of your containers. They follow the principle of least privilege.

4. **Language-Specific Variants:**
   Distroless provides language-specific variants for popular runtimes such as Java, Python, Node.js, and more. These variants come with the runtime pre-installed, making them suitable for language-specific applications.
